# Web3 Libraries

React is pretty basic web2 stuff, but if you want to write web3 app, you need a
library to glue the web2 stuffs and web3 stuffs together, that is
[web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) and [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/),
which I think it's simple to get started.

Between these two choices, much more people prefer to use `ethers.js`. I prefer to use
[Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain)
to generate the types at first with ethers.js used underlying (If you're only a frontend dev,
talk to your smart contract devs to generate the types files for you).

## Web3 wallet connectivity library

There are a lot of libraries handling the connectvity to the web3 wallet, the most used one is
[web3modal](https://web3modal.com/).

And I would like to highlight another one that has a more friendly interface, that is [web3-onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/).

## Libraries with React hooks

[useDapp](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp) as it provides easy to use React hooks and you can integrate it with
web3modal or web3-onboard when initiating connection, just pass the `provider` object to useDApp's `activate` function.

Also, there's another library [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) which provides more utilities such as erc20 abi.

Example code more to come.

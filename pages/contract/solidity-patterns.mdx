# Solidity Patterns

This chapter talks about Solidity Pattern that allows someone to write secure
code. Mainly takeaways from
[this page](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/), strongly recommend to
give it a read and get familiar with it.

## Highlight

- [Checks Effects Interactions](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html):
  prevents
  [reentrancy attack](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/reentrancy/)
- [Secure Ether Transfer](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/secure_ether_transfer.html):
  use `transfer()` rather than `send()`, also prevent the reentrancy attack
- [Randomness](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/randomness.html) and
  [Oracle](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/oracle.html)
- [Proxy Delegate](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/proxy_delegate.html):
  for contract upgradability
- [Tight Variable Packing](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/tight_variable_packing.html):
  pack variables into a word (32 bytes, i.e. `uint256`) as much as you can to
  save storage and gas

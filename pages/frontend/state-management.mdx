# State Management

State Management are almost the most tricky part about React. Here's why you
might want to use a State Management Library

## Redux

### Using Redux could make code a lot more cleaner:

Writing `setState(state => ({...state, updatedAttr}))` in everywhere is annoying,
especially some of their logic could be repeatedly appear in code.
That's why Redux uses `reducer` to encapsulate and record the update logic,
this can effectively avoid the copy and paste mistake and having to use global search
to change the update logic in case there is change in the state structure
(such as you might want to normalize the data).

First we define a reducer to define actions and transformation of data:

```jsx
export default function todosReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'todos/todoAdded': {
      // Can return just the new todos array - no extra object around it
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          id: nextTodoId(state),
          text: action.payload,
          completed: false,
        },
      ]
    }
}
```

Then in the component, the code looks like this

```jsx
const TodoList = () => {
  ...
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  ...
  const handleKeyDown = e => {
      // trim the text from event
      const trimmedText = ...
      // If the user pressed the Enter key:
      if (e.key === 'Enter' && trimmedText) {
        // Dispatch the "todo added" action with this text
        dispatch({ type: 'todos/todoAdded', payload: trimmedText })
        ...
      }
    }
  ...
}
```

### Redux also enforces you to use immutable state and pure functions to update the state

There are some principle with redux to ensure the state update is predictable, including

- states are read-only
- using a pure function to update the state using `reducer`,
  which must be supplied with old `state` and `action` object
  which has no side effects on `state`.

That means, you cannot use `state.someRandomAttr = someRandomVal` to update the state,
you have to use the `dispatch(action)` which is pure and has no side-effects, to update the state.

And sometimes when I use the `setState()` from the `useState()` API,
I might forget to pass a new object, instead I might just pass a
reference (which might not trigger the re-render).

This are the mistakes I made when I first started using React
(which I know now might generate some unpredictable behavior),
so if there's more new engineer that is getting started with React,
by enforces them only update the state using the `dispatch` API
(and its `reducer` is written by other more experienced engineers,
this will make the project progress more smoothly.

### Single source of truth makes development and debugging easier

If the application state is stored in different components,
using the react debugging tool could be hard to debug, because
you'll have to drill down to that component to read the state.

Single source of truth places the essential state in one place,
making it easier the pinpoint the problem.

Also, making single source of truth could just serialize your server's data into the single store.
When testing, the coupling of component and state are reduced,
isolating the core application state from other component is making the unit testing easier.

## Global state saves you from the hell of prop drilling

A common problem with a lot of React user is that when dealing with a tree of nested component,
we have the pass the data all the way from parent component to child component using prop,
which is commonly referred as prop drilling like this:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Parent() {
  const [fName, setfName] = useState("firstName");
  const [lName, setlName] = useState("LastName");
  return (
    <>
      <ChildA fName={fName} lName={lName} />
    </>
  );
}

function ChildA({ fName, lName }) {
  return (
    <>
      <ChildB fName={fName} lName={lName} />
    </>
  );
}

function ChildB({ fName, lName }) {
  return (
    <>
      <br />
      <ChildC fName={fName} lName={lName} />
    </>
  );
}

function ChildC({ fName, lName }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h4>{fName}</h4>
      <h4>{lName}</h4>
    </>
  );
}

export default Parent;
```

This is a vertical issue, there is also horizontal issue that a
component might need to pass down a lot of properties like this:

```jsx
<ChildC id={data.id} aName={data.aName} bName={data.bName} ... />
```

By using Redux, we don't need to pass the component properties
like this anymore, we just need to use the selector to get the states like this:

```jsx
function ChildC() {
  const { id, aName, bName, fName, lName } = useSelector((state) => state);
  return (
    <>
      <h4>{fName}</h4>
      <h4>{lName}</h4>
    </>
  );
}
```

### React Thunk to handle async flow

I think the biggest upside of Redux is that it actually allows
you to write real async flow when updating the global state

We introduce the concept of middleware now, which is similar to Express
and Axios or Filters in Spring Boot, you could put middlewares
(third party or even custom) between the action and the reducer.
One of it is to solve the `async` logic flow using `Thunk`

The `Thunk` framework itself is very simple, looks like this:

```jsx
const thunkMiddleware =
  ({ dispatch, getState }) =>
  (next) =>
  (action) => {
    // if action is function, call it
    if (typeof action === "function") {
      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);
    }

    // Otherwise, just continue processing this action as usual
    return next(action);
  };
```

To use it, we need to write a action creator (higher order function) like this:

```jsx
export const saveNewTodo = (text) => async (dispatch, getState) {
    const initialTodo = { text }
    const response = await client.post(..., { todo: initialTodo })
    dispatch({ type: 'todos/todoAdded', payload: response.todo })
  }
```

To dispatch the save todo in event handler, we need to call the
action creator to create a thunk function, then pass the thunk to dispatch

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux'

import { saveNewTodo } from '../todos/todosSlice'

const Header = () => {
  ...
  const dispatch = useDispatch()
  ...

  const handleKeyDown = e => {
    const trimmedText = ...
    if (e.which === 13 && trimmedText) {
      // then dispatch the thunk function itself
      dispatch(saveNewTodo(trimmedText))
      ...
    }
  }
...
}
```

## Other State Management Libraries to reduce boilerplatey code

One problem with Redux is that it could get very boilerplatey. There are
other state management library that gives you other flavors:

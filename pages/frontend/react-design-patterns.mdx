# React Design Patterns

[Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) is a great resource on design patterns
for js and React. I would like to highlight the following that has been used
extensively:

- Functional Component rather than Class Component
  - this is a personal preference, since it makes the component look a lot
    cleaner
- use React hooks
- HOC
  - allows you the create similar logic for different component
- Route Based Splitting
  - dynamic load content based on route
  - such as you can put contract address in the path

# Web3 Libraries

React is pretty basic web2 stuff, but if you want to write web3 app, you need a
library to glue the web2 stuffs and web3 stuffs together, that is
[web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) and [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/),
which I think it's simple to get started.

Between these two choices, much more people prefer to use `ethers.js`. I prefer to use
[Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain)
to generate the types at first with ethers.js used underlying (If you're only a frontend dev,
talk to your smart contract devs to generate the types files for you).

Also, [useDapp](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp) is recommended as it integrates with React.

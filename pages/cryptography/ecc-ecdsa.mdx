# Elliptic Curve Cipher And ECDSA

This topic is finally relevant to Blockchain!! We get there!!

If you skipped the other parts, I still think other parts are still crucial to
understand.

ECC (Elliptic Curve Cipher) uses **smaller key** than RSA, but provides the same
level of security and speed.

## ECC keys

The key generation is very simple, just to generate a random integer in a
certain range. e.g. any number that is under 256 bits (which is a very large
range, impossible to brute-forcefully crack the private key to yield the same
result unless it is already known).

The public key in the ECC is laying on `{x, y}` on the curve **(EC points)** and
this point can be compressed into one coordinates plus one bit (even or odd).
Hence if the private key is 256 bits, the public key will be 257 bits.

## Curves

Different curves could be used by different ECC algos, which differs themselves
from security, key length and performance.

Each ECC curves have their own names (e.g. `secp256k1`), field-size (e.g.
256-bit), and other params.

## ECC Maths

This [page](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticCurve.html) gave us a full
form of elliptic curve, but it could be simplified like this:

```
y^2 = x^3 + a x + b
```

e.g. The NIST curve [secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) used in
Bitcoin use the curve

```
y^2 = x^3 + 7
```

where `a = 0, b = 7`.

Here's a [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ialhd71we3) that can makes
you play with the curve.

## ECC Maths in practice

In practice, the ECC curve will be taken to a finite field, that will mod the
result of EC with a certain number `p`, so that there is only `p` number of
points on the EC.

## EC point multiplication

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_point_multiplication)
actually help me understand the EC. Before you understand EC point
multiplication, you need to understand **point addition** and **point
doubling**.

### Point addition & doubling

<Callout>Addition is the case 1, where P + Q = **R** (P + Q + R = 0)</Callout>
<Callout>Doubling is the case 2, where Q + Q = **P** (P + Q + Q = 0)</Callout>

### Point multiplication

This [section] list out different algo of computing the multiplication.

The simplest method to understand is the "Double-And-Add" method (to compute
`K = k * G`):

```
let bits = bit_representation(k)
let res = math.inf

let temp = G # track doubled P val
for bit in bits:
    if bit == 1:
        res = res + temp # point add
    temp = temp + temp # double
return res
```

We can see the algorithm just does very simple stuffs: iteractively add (on odd
bits) and double (on even bits).

### Properties of EC point multiplication

There are two properties of EC point multiplication: `K = k * G`:

<Callout>
  Given known `G` and `K`, it's very slow (infeasible) to compute the value `k`
  back. Proven by
  [ECDLP](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#elliptic-curve-discrete-logarithm-problem-ecdlp)
</Callout>
<Callout>If `k = 0`, the result will be a special infinity line.</Callout>

### EC subgroups and co-factors

Suppose there are `n = r * h` points on a finite-field EC, there are only `h`
number of non-overlapping subgroups (each group contains `r` points).

`h` is also called the "co-factors" of an EC curve. `r` is also called the
"order" of an EC curve.

- Example of elliptic curve having `cofactor = 1` is `secp256k1`
- Example of elliptic curve having `cofactor = 8` is `Curve25519`
- Example of elliptic curve having `cofactor = 4` is `Curve448`

## Apply EC point multiplication to PKC

Using the EC point multiplication property, we can easily determine that, given
a formula `K = k * G`:

<Callout>
  `k` should be the private key (it shouldn't be easily reverse-computed).
</Callout>
<Callout>`K` should be the public key.</Callout>
<Callout>
  `G` is called "generator point", needs to be carefully selected.
</Callout>

This
[section](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#the-generator-point-in-ecc)
tells us how scientists carefully selects the generator `G`.

> To summarize, in the ECC cryptography the EC points, together with the
> generator point `G` form cyclic groups (or cyclic subgroups), which means that
> a number `r` exists (`r > 1`), such that `r * G = 0 * G = infinity` and all
> points in the subgroup can be obtained by multiplying `G` by integer in the
> range [1...r]. The number `r` is called order of the group (or subgroup).

EC could have many generator `G`, but we only need to pick one to make sure the
performance and security is optimized.

Different `G` also yields subgroups of different order. We need to make sure the
order `r` is large enough to defend the
[small subgroup attack](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2785). And this `r`
needs to be a prime number.

## Key length strength and security

> Because the fastest known algorithm to solve the **ECDLP** for key of size `k`
> needs `sqrt(k)` steps, this means that to achieve a k-bit security strength,
> at least `2^k`-bit curve is needed. Thus 256-bit elliptic curves (where the
> field size p is 256-bit number) typically provide nearly 128-bit security
> strength.

from
[cryptobook](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#ecc-and-curve-security-strength)

<Callout>
  Choose an EC algo with key of at least 256 bits, also only choose `G` that is
  proven to be safe.
</Callout>

## Public Key Compression

Another important property of EC is that there are at most 2 coordinates that
exists given same `y` (odd `x` and even `x`). See this
[section](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/asymmetric-key-ciphers/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecc#public-key-compression-in-the-elliptic-key-cryptosystems).
That's why the public key only needs the `x` coordinates and plus one bit with
`odd` or `even`.

<Callout>Ethereum only uses uncompressed public keys.</Callout>

## ECDSA

The process of ECDSA is similar to
[RSA](asymmetric-cipher-rsa#how-to-apply-the-keys-to-digital-signatures), using
the private key to sign and using the public key to verify.

### ECDSA Sign

1. compute message hash `h` using hash function like `SHA-256`: `h = hash(msg)`
2. generate a cryptographically secure random number `k` in the range of
   `[1,n-1]`
   - note that this is not the private key `k` we mentioned before!!! but it
     should be kept secret too
   - **every signature should choose a different `k` so that keys are not easily
     figured out**
   - for deterministic-ECDSA, the value `k` is HMAC-derived from `h + privKey`
     (this is to make sure given the same `msg`, the signatures are the same)
3. calculate `R = k * G` and extract x coordinate of `R`: `r = R.x`
4. calculate the signature proof: `s = k^-1 * (h + r * privKey) mod n`
   - `k * k^-1 = 1 mod n`
5. return the signature `{r, s}`

In summary:

> The **signing** encodes a random point `R` (represented by its x-coordinate
> only) through elliptic-curve transformations using the private key `privKey`
> and the message hash `h` into a number `s`, which is the proof that the
> message signer knows the private key `privKey`. The signature `{r, s}` cannot
> reveal the private key due to the difficulty of the ECDLP problem.

### ECDSA Verify

Suppose signature `{r, s}` and original message are given, all you need to do is
to recover the random point `r` from the result `s` and `pubKey` to learn about
if the signature is from the key holder.

1. compute message hash `h` using hash function like `SHA-256`: `h = hash(msg)`
2. modular reverse the signature `s`: `s' = s^-1 mod n`
3. recover the random point by `R' = (h * s') * G + (r * s') * pubKey`
4. take the `r'`: `r' = R'.x`
5. compare whether `r' == r`, if they are not the same, the signature is not
   from the key holder!

In summary:

> The signature **verification** decodes the proof number `s` from the signature
> back to its original point `R` , using the public key `pubKey` and the message
> hash `h` and compares the x-coordinate of the recovered `R` with the `r` value
> from the signature.

### The Math

This
[section](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/digital-signatures/ecdsa-sign-verify-messages#the-math-behind-the-ecdsa-sign-verify)
gives the math proof why the verification is valid. In short, it's all math
substitutions and the simplifications.

### ECDSA Public Key Recovery from Signature

ECDSA allows the public key to be recovered from the `{r,s}`, and returns 0, 1
and 2 possible EC points that could be valid public keys, so to avoid the
ambiguity, the signature need to have one extra bit `v`, so the signature become
`{r,s,v}`.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm#Public_key_recovery)
explained how that is done.

### Major Malleability

This [article](https://hackmd.io/@seaona/rJz7Cxw7K#Create-a-Signature) explains
how one could fake the signature:

Suppose we sign the message:

```js
const signature = key.sign(msgHash);
```

The result is going to be `{r,s}`

But, we can use two signatures to potentially pass the validation:

```
{r, s}
```

```
{r, -s mod n}
```

`n` is the size of the range of a random number, which could be derived from the
EC. Hence the second result could be derived

That's why the verification algo should also verify whether it's the lower `s`.

A lot of programming languages' native crypto library might not have such
verification, including Solidity. That's why one should use
[OZ's util library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol)
to verify signature.

They have a line of code checking whether `s` is the lower `s`:

```solidity
if (uint256(s) > 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0) {
  return (address(0), RecoverError.InvalidSignatureS);
}
```

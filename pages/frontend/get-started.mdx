# Frontend Get Started

## Frontend Frameworks

The default frontend framework you need to master in web3 is [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Although there are some other tech choices like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/),
[Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/),
but none of them is comparable to React in terms of prevalence in web3, even in web2.
I can see none of these library will front run `React` anytime soon since React
has great community support and resources (libraries, frameworks, components, other wheels).

Traditionally, the backend can generate html template to dynamically render content with
imperative approach, but `React` uses a declarative approach so that the code is actually
easier to understand, see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33655534/difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-in-react-js).
`React`'s prevalence is also thanks to the recent trend of
[multi-tier architecture](https://www.guru99.com/n-tier-architecture-system-concepts-tips.html).

Here are some of the resources to get started on `React`:

- [Official Doc](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Full Stack MOOC](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
- [Scrimba: Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)

## Language

There's a language choice as well, use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
instead of Javascript can save you a lot of pain since it could lint your code,
check simple mistakes and type errors so that it saves you a lot of time
(especially if you're using Create React App, the rendering time to check your errors is a huge pain).

And there's a guide on how to write clean and effective js/ts code:

- [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

Here is a trick when you're stuck on type problems as a beginner (usually on function argument):

Hover to your editor's variable and you should get a prompt on the types on argument, copy that type down
and use your editor's auto import to import that types

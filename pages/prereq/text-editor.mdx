# Text Editor

You want to roll up your sleeves with a text editor. Here I'm talking about what
choices you got.

## vim or Emacs

The OG one to use is [vim](https://www.vim.org/), you can't get away with it
since you will gonna need it when doing server configurations (sometimes you
might need to do it).

Here's a [guide](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) on vim.

And another text editor gurus like to use is
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (they all claim themselves to be
10x developer).

Here a [guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/) on Emacs (you'll have
to rememeber a lot of key combinations, that's probably why I can't be a 10x
developer).

## VScode

[VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is de-facto most popular text editor
which had front run Atom & Sublime Text.

The reason it won is the rich support of plugins and the fact that it was backed
by Microsoft (maybe). Anyway, VScode is always improving (I remember I used to
open VSCode, my fan won't stop, now I open VSCode, it's indeed smoother,
probably my laptop has evolved).

Its guide can be found on the official site.

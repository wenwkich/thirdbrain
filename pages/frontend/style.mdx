## Layouts

If you're just getting started on CSS, I would recommend
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and
[Material UI](https://mui.com/) as they are very popular and universal, they are
easy to get started as they doesn't assume you have knowledge on advanced CSS
concepts such as flexbox and grid.

But if you want to get more control over layouts, here's a useful
[guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) on flexbox.

My previous favorite framework writing css is
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), as it allows you to write
css and js in the same file like `Vue`. I used to like to create a wrapper
component using `styled`, and wrap the content component to create custom
layout.

However, my personal favorite right now is
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), as it allows you to craft the layout in
utility class names without implementing your own class, but it assumes you to
have knowledge on flexbox and grid.

## Reusable Component

Here are some of the libraries that provides reusable component like buttons,
form and pop-ups:

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/)

React Bootstrap is looking pretty typical and pretty hard to customize.

MUI could be very complex to master, and I don't like the look of the component
if I don't customize it.

And my favorite among them will be Chakra, as its default component doesn't look
that typical and provide some useful hooks and even advanced feature like Toast
and Portal (although I think MUI has it as well) so I think this is the reason
why Chakra is so popular among startups.

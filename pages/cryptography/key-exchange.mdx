# Key Exchange and Diffie-Hellman

Key Exchange is the protocol where two parties share a secret, typically for
encrypted communications. There are two techniques:

- key agreemment: two parties are involved, example:
  - Diffie-Hellman (DHKE)
  - Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
- key transport: one party generate the key, the other party obtain the key from
  it, typically through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), examples:
  - RSA key exchange

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE)

[DHKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) uses a
**public channel** (insecure) to exchange crypto keys anonymously (doesn't need
to have prior knowledge of each other), which is known to be
**sniffing-resistant** (others cannot know the keys), but not resistant to
man-in-the-middle (but other can sabotage your keys).

## DHKE by mixing color

This
[section](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/key-exchange/diffie-hellman-key-exchange#key-exchange-by-mixing-colors)
contains good illustration of how DHKE is like:

1. Alice and Bob agrees on a certain color (this is what's public)
2. Alice and Bob selects a secret color (this is secret)
3. Alice and Bob mix the color in step 1 and step 2 and they are ready to
   exchange
4. Alice and Bob get each other's color and mix it with their own secret color,
   get the **common secret**

DHKE uses same concept but uses
[discrete logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) and
[modular exponentiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation)
instead of color mixing.

## The math behind DHKE

This
[section](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/key-exchange/diffie-hellman-key-exchange#the-diffie-hellman-key-exchange-dhke-protocol)
explains how DHKE is done mathematically. (The notation is a bit messy though).
So I've cleared it up like this:

> It uses the property of (g^a)^b mod p = (g^b)^a mod p, where g, a, b and p are
> positive integers.

> If we have A = g^a mod p and B = g^b mod p, we can calculate g^(ab) mod p,
> without revealing a or b (which are called secret exponents).

> Then it is known if we have m, g and p, and given m = g^s mod p, there is no
> fast algo to find s.

The "Cryptographic Explanation" page under
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
did a good job explaining how does DHKE works, it even lighlights what secret
and not, I'll summarize it using the analogy of mixing color:

1. _Alice and Bob agrees on a certain color_
   - they both choose a modulus p = 23 and base g = 5 (these ain't secrets)
2. _Alice and Bob selects a secret color (this is secret)_
   - Alice choose secret a = 4
   - Bob choose secret b = 3 (these are secrets)
3. _Alice and Bob mix the color in step 1 and step 2_
   - Alice computes A = g^a mod p = 5^4 mod 23 = 4, sends A to Bob
   - Bob computes B = g^b mod p = 5^3 mod 23 = 10, sends B to Alice
4. _Alice and Bob get each other's color and mix it with their own secret color_
   - Alice gets the common secret by s = B^a mod p = 10^4 mod 23 = 18
   - Bob gets the common secret by s = A^b mod p = 4^3 mod 23 = 18

Hence the common secret they got is 18!!!!

Other method such as ECDH just replace the discrete log and mod with ellipical
curve, I'm ready to discover that!

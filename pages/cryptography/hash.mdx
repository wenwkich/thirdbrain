# Hash Functions

Hash functions should be the topic every developer to know about, especially
you've just started on developement.

## Definition

- one way function (inreversible)
  - meaning infeasible to invert (must use brute-force method)
- deterministic
  - meaning given the same input, the output of a hash function must be the same
- fast
  - the calculation of hash should be fast
- hard to analyze
  - small input change yields result drastically different
  - the result should be totally random just like someone smashed the keyboard
- strong crypto hash functions are collision-proof (such as SHA-256)

## Application

The most common one is for **document integrity validation**. You will always
see some files downloads are provided with a hash, that is for you to validate
if the file you download has been tampered.

One of the most senseless thing a backend developer can do is storing password
directly in the database, if database is exploited, hacker coould easily figure
out the password. **Passwords should be hashed instead.**

## Application in blockchain

It is initially used as something to make the block "immutable" (no one can
change a historical block of a blockchain).

Remind you the blockchain is also a data structure which **previous block's
hash** will be included in the next block, so that the validator could validate
the hashes from the start to end.

To shorten the data stored in blockchain, **transaction are also hashed** so
that it could be included in a structure called
[Merkle Proof](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/merkle-proofs-for-offline-data-integrity/),
so that only the root is stored in blockchain, the rest of the proof is stored
off the chain.

The
[Proof-of-Work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/)
is also using **hash functions as the difficulty** a miner has to "proof" that
they have "work" on the blockchain.

## Weakness

Please be reminded if the result is intended not to be totally random, the
likelihood for it to be exploited is larger than those who look totally
different. Check
[Profanity hack](https://halborn.com/explained-the-profanity-address-generator-hack-september-2022/),
Wintermute (a crypto fund) losing millions of dollar in it ("a set of 1,000 GPUs
could theoretically brute force the private keys of every 7-character vanity
address generated using Profanity **within 50 days**").

Your password also should be using something that's too easily known or
repeatedly used, because someone could run the
[rainbow table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-rainbow-table-attack/)
on you, unless the application developer
[salted](https://auth0.com/blog/adding-salt-to-hashing-a-better-way-to-store-passwords/)
the password for you.

## Secure Hash Algorithm

This
[doc](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/2/archive/2002-08-01/documents/fips180-2.pdf)
should do the full explanation of the SHA family.

The concept behind the algo is
[Merkle-Damgård construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction),
the hashed value is just the last chaining words of bitwise computaions to the
message block padded (initially), previous chaining words and the predefined
constants (throughout the initialization and in between iterations).

The computation of SHA is very a trivial process for developer to understand,
but as developers, we need to understand SHA1 and some of the SHA2 (a newer
family) is not safe either. SHA-256, SHA-386 and SHA-512 are safe to use (the
number is the bits of output digest).

Most of the following are just takeaways from the pdf, you might not able to
understand if you don't look at the specific calculations:

- SHA-1 and SHA-256 are for input less than 2^64 bits
- SHA-384 and SHA-512 are for input less than 2^128 bits
- SHA-1 generates 160 bits outcome, which is considered
  [insecure](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/48289/how-secure-is-sha1-what-are-the-chances-of-a-real-exploit)
  - a collision could found at the cost of 2^80, which is feasible to attack
- SHA-1 or SHA-2 are just repeatedly looping piping of bitwise operations word
  by word (Merkle-Damgård construction)
- in SHA-256, a word is 32 bits (and uses 8 words as variables to pipe
  continuously, hence the 256 bits output), and in SHA-512, a word is 64 bits
  (also uses 8 words to pipe, hence the 512 bits outputs)
- SHA-256 uses a sequence of 64 constant 32-bits words which in fact are just
  prime numbers, used within each iterations in the loop, meaning it's doing 64
  iterations, whereas SHA-512 uses 80 constant 32-bits words

There's a new family SHA-3, which contains Keccak-256 (solidity dev should be
very familiar with it).

The major difference is that it uses
[sponge functions](https://keccak.team/sponge_duplex.html), which solves a
vulnerability that SHA-1 and some of the SHA-2 might face:
[length-extension attacks](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3978/understanding-the-length-extension-attack)
(Heckers could embed the message at the end to reproduce the collision without
knowing the message).

Most blockchains use SHA-256 / Keccak-256 algorithm which are collison-proof.

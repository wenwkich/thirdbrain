# Frameworks and Tools

Apart from writing solidity, you need a framework (with tools integrated) to
help you test the code, deploy in the simulated / blockchain environement, or
write some script do some block-ops.

## [Remix](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This one should be the easiest to get started cuz everything is in the browser.
Supports [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and
[web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/). Suitable for those who
don't want to use cli.

And you can
[connect Remix with local filesystem](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remixd.html#remixd-access-your-local-filesystem),
so that you could write the code in the editor and do the testing in UI.

I usually choose it when I want to use Metamask to deploy the contract (which
other frameworks can't do really).

## [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)

The framework to use back in the OG days.

I think what's special about it is that you need to write migration contract and
it provides a console that you could interactively write Javascript commands.

It contains the ganache tools which can simulate a EVM and even support forking
from existing blockchain.

## [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial)

This is almost the default choice to smart contract development right now.

I think why people like hardhat so much is because they provide a `console.log`
that you can debug directly in the Solidity Code.

Plus, you could integrate it with both ethers.js and web3.js to deploy the
contract. I prefer [hardhat deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy)
as it produce replicable deployments.

It also provides a hardhat local network.

## [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)

Usually I use hardhat to test, I couldn't take it because it's kinda slow.

But Foundry came to combat that with a super fast testing toolkit.

And it's most attractive feature is to allow testing in **Solidity**, so that
you can write tests with efficiency. That really turns boring chores into
something pleasurable.

# Welcome

This is my very detailed personal opinions, examples, guide, curated resources
on web2/3 development.

No matter you're complete newbie to even web2 or web2/3 dev with some
experience, hope you'll find this doc helpful to get comfortable with web3
development.

**If you're really noob, please get started with "Prerequisite", if you're not,
skip this part cuz that's too many baby steps**

Here are some of the good resources you can refer to as well:

- [devpill.me](https://www.devpill.me/)
- [useWeb3.xyz](https://www.useweb3.xyz/)
- [Learn Web3](https://learnweb3.io/)
- [DeFi-Developer-Road-Map](https://github.com/OffcierCia/DeFi-Developer-Road-Map)
- [awesome-web3](https://github.com/ahmet/awesome-web3) (Reminder: If you want
  to find any curated resource, just add `awesome-` in front of your topic on
  Github)

## Web2 Concept Pre-req

If you don't even know what frontend and backend are (the traditional
architecture), you need to know about these concepts of web2 first (google it if
you don't understand):

- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)
  - request & response
  - method
    - specify what actions, typcially GET (get resource), POST (create new
      resource), PUT (modify resource) and DELETE (delete resource)
  - URL
    - use URI to specify location
  - header
  - client vs server
- **Frontend** is on the client side
  - Responsible for presentation, it's the code lying in your browser
  - Always initiates the request
- **Backend** is on the server side, it's the code lying in the remote,
  centralized server
  - responsible for handling client's request, biz logic, data persistance
  - listen to request, then process the request to send the response
- Data persistence
  - use centralized database to store your data
- [API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces)
  (an **interface** that softwares agree on, used for communication)
- [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)
  - a stateless interface that frontend and backend agree on, typcially over
    HTTP
  - use JSON to transmit the payload typcially
- Identity & Authentication
  - Register & Login
  - Username & password
  - Backend use Session or JWT (and other stuff) to identify user, then find
    user information in the database to control and restrict access to user

BTW, this [article](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) gives a great
detailed review of what happens under the scene when you use the browser.

## Web2 vs Web3

Web3 typically differs from web2 from following aspect:

- use **decentralized** infrastructures to (partially) replace your centralized
  backend server, typically using the blockchain
- use smart contract lying in blockchain to serve client's request & store your
  data
- still uses the http protocol (or WebSocket) to transmit data underlyingly,
  instead of RESTful API
  - use [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html) to "send
    transaction" to blockchain communicate between smart contract & client
    - consists of
      - contract location to identify the resource
      - function selector
      - arguments
- use PKI to identify user, see
  [Cryptography Section of Master Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-addresses.asciidoc)
  and
  [Wallets](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/05wallets.asciidoc)
  - user sign a transaction which is verifiable by anyone **without revealing
    the private key (the secret)** and populated it to blockchain instead of
    giving username & password to server to authenticate first
  - smart contract can access your wallet address, so it's natural that they can
    restrict access to some addresses

I recommend reading
[Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) before
getting started on web3 dev.

# Web3 Libraries

React is pretty basic web2 stuff, but if you want to write web3 app, you need a
library to glue the web2 stuffs and web3 stuffs together, that is
[web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) and
[ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), which I think it's simple
to get started.

Between these two choices, much more people prefer to use `ethers.js`. I prefer
to use [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) to generate the
types at first with ethers.js used underlying (If you're only a frontend dev,
talk to your smart contract devs to generate the types files for you).

## Concept of JSON RPC

Ethereum runs [JSON RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
protocol to interact (including reading blockchain state and write data to
blockchain), versus web2 applications usually use REST API.

For example, to call `eth_getBalance` method, you can write curl script like
this:

```
// Request
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x407d73d8a49eeb85d32cf465507dd71d507100c1", "latest"],"id":1}'
// Result
{
  "id":1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x0234c8a3397aab58" // 158972490234375000
}
```

Your favorite web3 libraries just wrap all the complication of JSON RPC into a
easier to use API.

## Web3 wallet modal libraries

There are a lot of libraries handling the connectvity to the web3 wallet, the
most used one is [web3modal](https://web3modal.com/).

And I would like to highlight another one that has a more friendly interface,
that is [web3-onboard](https://onboard.blocknative.com/).

There are also other toolkit by wallets like
[ConnectKit](https://docs.family.co/connectkit) and
[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/)

## Libraries with React hooks

[useDApp](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp) as it provides easy to use React
hooks and you can integrate it with web3modal or web3-onboard when initiating
connection, just pass the `provider` object to useDApp's `activate` function.

Also, there's another library [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) which provides more
utilities such as erc20 abi.

My opinion is that, you should use useDApp if you want to integrate with other
web3 modal library, that will give you a unified interface to get providers /
account.

If you will write your own modal and want to gain more control to the web3
connectivity, use wagmi.

## Multicall

To reduce the call to the rpc, you should also consider using multicall.

The multicall idea is originated from
[MakerDAO's multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall) contract.

Note that this is different from Uniswap's multicall which will write to
blockchain, MakerDAO's multicall do the query only.

I think [ethcall](https://github.com/Destiner/ethcall) is good as it supports
deployless contract. But the library is little bit confusing to use.

I wrote a
[declarative-multicall](https://www.npmjs.com/package/declarative-multicall) to
simplfied the ethcall control for you.

## Examples

And you can see an example of
[how to use declarative-multicall](https://github.com/wenwkich/simple-defi-dashboard)
here. It includes other topic such as
[how to useDApp with web3Modal](https://github.com/wenwkich/simple-defi-dashboard/blob/main/src/components/common/activateWeb3Modal.tsx)
,
[how to useDApp with web3-onboard](https://github.com/wenwkich/simple-defi-dashboard/blob/main/src/components/common/activateWeb3Onboard.tsx)
also how to integrate it with
[React Query](https://github.com/wenwkich/simple-defi-dashboard/tree/main/src/hooks)

## Numbers

Another tricky place to web3 library is the number handling. I've seen some bugs
that pass the truncated input to write the chain, but the truncated number is
greater than the number on chain, which cannot be successfully written.

Also, you would need to handle the number every time by calling ethers'
`ethers.utils.formatUnits()` function.

## Examples

I rolled up an example in the

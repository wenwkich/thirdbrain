# JSON

No matter you develop on web2 or web3, you need to know about a very important
data format, that is JSON (Javascript Object Notation).

Javascript is so prevalent so that its data format becomes the most universal
and one for the internet to exchange data.

Its format is very easy to interpreted but Imma throw a
[guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
to you.

JSON uses the notation uses `{}` stands for object and `[]` stands for list,
which can contain another object or list.

JSON allows basic data types like boolean (`true` or `false`), number (`1`) and
string (uses a double quote, like `"abc"`).

Object refers to a data structure with attributes (attributes are string
mostly), you can see them as key-value-pair, like

```json
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
```

This object has the attribute `"a"` with the value `1`, and attribute `"b"` with
the value `2`

You can also nest the objects or list like this:

```json
{
  "A": {
    "a": 1
  }
}
```

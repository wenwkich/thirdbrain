# React Design Patterns

[Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) is a great resource on design patterns for js and React.
I would like to highlight the following that has been used extensively:

- Functional Component rather than Class Component
- use functional programming on iterables
  - utility library such as [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- Hooks
  - `useState()` hook to store simple data
  - `useEffect()` hook to replace `componentDidMount()` `componentWillUnmount()` and `componentDidUpdate()`
    to manage lifecycles
  - `useConext()` hook to allow you access global state by `Context` API of react
  - `useReducer()` hook to allow you use Redux-style code to manage state lifecycle
  - `useCallback()` hook to return memorized callback, here's a [guide](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-usecallback/)
  - `useRef()` hook to fold elements and mutable values
  - react hook utility such as [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)
    - `useThrottle()` and `useDebounce()` allows you to reduce frequent calls
  - [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): A strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data
    - similar library that does this is [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/?from=reactQueryV3&original=https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/)
- HOC
  - allows you the create similar logic for different component
- Route Based Splitting
  - dynamic load content based on route

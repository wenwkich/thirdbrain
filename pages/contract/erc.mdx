# ERC

First, you have to know what is
[EIP and ERC](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-eip-and-erc-and-how-are-they-connected/#:~:text=As%20stated%20in%20EIP%2D1,%2C%20networking%2C%20interface%20and%20ERC).

Simply put, they define the standard.

## ERC20

> An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is
> exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior
> associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium
> of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

## ERC721

> ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that
> is, where each token is unique, such as real estate, voting rights, or
> collectibles, where some items are valued more than others, due to their
> usefulness, rarity, etc.

# Bootstrap Your Web3 App

At first, you would want to bootstrap rather than build from scratch, so here
are some personal opinions on bootstrap choices.

## Create React App (CRA)

A lot of beginners use
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or CRA to
bootstrap a Single Page App (SPA) since it gives you a lot of default
configurations so that you can quickly setup an app with no extra efforts (this
fits the "Conventions over Configuration" paradigm).

To override some of the configurations (such as babel, webpack, eslint), you can
use [CRACO](https://github.com/dilanx/craco) to do that. You need knowledge on
Webpack to configure that. Here's a
[guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/webpack-beginner-guide/) on Webpack since
sometimes you need to polyfill nodejs library like `crypto` in web3 development

## Alternative to CRA to speed up rendering time

I think the rendering time of CRA is too slow, so I would use
[vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bootstrap an SPA.

## Alternative to CRA for importing Web3 Libraries as well

Here are some good resource on bootstrapping web3 dapp with templates:

- [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app), used
  [useDapp](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/useDApp) library
- [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth)

I would personally prefer bootstrapping the app using these tools and switch to
`vite` for faster rendering, as it's easier to migrate to `vite` instead of
installing all the web3 libraries from scratch. Here's a
[guide](https://cathalmacdonnacha.com/migrating-from-create-react-app-cra-to-vite)
on how to migrate.

## Server Side Rendering

Another thing to consider when bootstrapping is whether you want SSR.

Typically, if you want your site to be indexable to google and other site such
as Twitter to show a preview of your site, you should consider server-side
rendering.

Also, SSR is typically faster to load as it doesn't load the whole app (it loads
on demand), while CSR (or single page app) are smoother to use as it doesn't
refresh when you go to another page.

Use [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) if
this is your choice.

# Introduction

Hi, starting from this chapter, it's not like a development guide, it's more
like my personal study notes and exploration for more advanced topics, starting
from Cryptography, which builds the foundation of web3.

I have studied crypto in university, but very limited (They didn't really cover
much practical concepts in real life like Digital Signatures) and I think I've
returned most of my knowledge back to professors. But then I discovered Ethereum
and I really studied hard about the concept of Digital Signatures (and through
signing transactions in real life) and it turned out to be really easy. I think
what I lack is the deeper mathematical understanding on some of the topics, and
I was never bothered to understand real math behind what's really relevant to
blockchains, that are Elliptical Curves and ZK. So this chapter should enhance
my understanding on these topics, especially on EC and ZK. Hope they can make
you "unstuck" on some of the concepts too.

This notes has included contents from
[Practical Cryptography for Developer](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/) and some
external articles and Wikipedia (I think editors for crypto really make the
study easier)

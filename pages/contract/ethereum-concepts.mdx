# Ethereum Concepts

Smart Contracts are the programs that **governs** the behavior of state in
blockchains that are wrapped by state machines.

It is **not** related to:

- Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence (not smart)
- Legal (don't have legal bounds, not like a real-world contracts)
- Automatically stuffs (you need to manipulate with a
  [EOA](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/5828/what-is-an-eoa-account))

We mentioned "state" & "machine", this is what Ethereum differs from Bitcoin,
see [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/)

A lot of people are confused by the buzzword "Virtual Machine", thinking it's
really like a traditional VM using VirtualBox, a sandbox with Operation System
running in it.

Actually, the word VM refers to
[virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization), it refers to an
abstract layer to a phsyical machine's resources like storage and networks.

The EVM doc should also show you an illustration of VM, its execution layer is
volatile and
[stack-based](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/35628/why-is-the-ethereum-virtual-machine-designed-as-a-stack-based-language),
versus the [register-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine) one.

And it has a virtual ROM which stores immutable contract codes, and a storage
for accounts (smart contract writes to this account storage) and a storage for
the world state.

Why it is a "state" machine? Because it produced a
[deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system) and atomic
(all or nothing) output given a input like a mathemetical function:

```
Y(S, T)= S'
```

> Given an old valid state (S) and a new set of valid transactions (T), the
> Ethereum state transition function Y(S, T) produces a new valid output state
> S'

[eth.build](https://eth.build/) is also a good sandbox for you to know how
ethereum works.

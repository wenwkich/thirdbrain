# Welcome

This is my very detailed personal opinions, examples, guide, curated resources on web3 development.

No matter you're complete newbie to web dev or web2 dev with some experience, hope you'll find this doc helpful.

Here are some of the good resources you can refer to as well:

- [devpill.me](https://www.devpill.me/)
- [useWeb3.xyz](https://www.useweb3.xyz/)
- [DeFi-Developer-Road-Map](https://github.com/OffcierCia/DeFi-Developer-Road-Map)
- [awesome-web3](https://github.com/ahmet/awesome-web3) (Reminder: If you want to find any curated resource, just add `awesome-` in front of your topic on Github)

## Web2 Concept Pre-req

If you don't even know what frontend and backend are (the traditional architecture),
you need to know about these concepts of web2 first:

- http (request & response, client vs server)
- frontend is on the client side
  - responsible for presentation, it's the code lying in your browser
  - always initiates the request
- backend is on the server side, it's the code lying in the remote, centralized server
  - responsible for handling client's request, biz logic, data persistance
  - listen to request, then process the request to send the response
- Data persistence
  - use centralized database to store your data
- API (an **interface** that frontend and backend agree on, used for communication)
- RESTful API
  - use URI to specify location
  - use METHOD to specify what actions,
    typcially GET (get resource), POST (create new resource), PUT (modify resource) and DELETE (delete resource)
  - use JSON to transmit the payload typcially
- Identity & Authentication
  - Register & Login
  - Account name & password
  - Backend use session or jwt to identify user to control and restrict access to user

## Web2 vs Web3

Web3 typically differs from web2 from following aspect:

- use **decentralized** infrastructures to (partially) replace your centralized
  backend server, typically using the blockchain
- use smart contract lying in blockchain to serve client's request & store your data
- still uses the http protocol to transmit data underlyingly, not doesn't interact thru RESTful API
  - use [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html) to "send transaction" to blockchain
    communicate between smart contract & client
    - consists of
      - contract location to identify the resource
      - function selector
      - arguments
- use PKI to identify user, see
  [Cryptography Section of Master Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/04keys-addresses.asciidoc)
  and [Wallets](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/05wallets.asciidoc)
  - user sign a transaction which is verifiable by anyone **without revealing the private key (the secret)**
    and populated it to blockchain instead of giving username & password to server to authenticate first
  - smart contract use wallet address to restrict access to some accounts

I recommend reading [Mastering Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
before getting started on web3 dev.

# Asymmetric Cipher and RSA

The most common asymmetric algorithms are RSA and ECC. The idea of "asymmetric"
is that unlike "symmetric", it uses two key, one is **public key** (publicly
known & can be exposed) and the other one is **private key** (should be kept
secret). The benefit is to make key exchange less of a hassle.

## Public Key Cryptography - Concepts

The idea behind PKC is easy, as
[illustrated](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/encryption-symmetric-and-asymmetric#public-key-encryption-decryption).

<Callout>
  Use **public key** to encrypt, and then use **private key** to decrypt.
</Callout>

## Digital Signature - Concepts

The idea behind the Digital Signature is exactly the reverse of PKC, as
[illustrated](https://cryptobook.nakov.com/encryption-symmetric-and-asymmetric#signatures-asymmetric-signing-verification).

Note that digital signatures are not for encryption, it's for validation to know
a message is issued by someone who holds the private key.

<Callout>Use **private key** to sign, use **public key** to verify.</Callout>

## RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

### Math property

RSA uses the property of
`(m^e)^d = (m^d)^e = m mod n for all m in range of [0...n)`.

You can see `m` as the message, `e` as the encryption key and `d` as the
decryption key.

### Process

This [article](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-rsa-algorithm) or
[wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation>)
explains what RSA is like:

1. select two large prime number: `x`, `y`
   - `x` and `y` should be kept secret and choose randomly
2. calculate `n = x * y`
   - `n` is used as modulus and part of the private/public key
3. calculate `totient(n) = (x-1)(y-1)` (usually totient is the least common
   multiple and may be calculated by euclidean algo)
   - `totient(n)` should be kept secret
4. select an integer `e`, so that `e` is co-prime to `totient(n)`
   - co-prime means two integers' greatest common divisor is 1, i.e.
     `gcd(e, totient(n)) = 1`
   - `1 < e < totient(n)`, `(n, e)` makes up the **public key (used for
     encryption & signature verification)**
5. calculate `e*d = 1 mod totient(n)`
   - `d` could be found using
     [extended euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm),
     and the pair `(n, d)` makes up the **private key (used for decryption &
     signing)**

### Encryption & Decryption

Let's suppose Bob holds the **private key**, and he made the public key known to
everyone else.

<Callout>
  Alice wants to write a ciphertext to Bob so that only Bob knows the original
  message, so she encrypts a plain text `P`, and derives the ciphertext `C` with
  `C = P^e mod n` to send to Bob
</Callout>
<Callout>
  Bob then recievea ciphertext `C`, only he can decrypt the plain text `P` with
  `P = C^d mod n`
</Callout>

### How to apply the keys to Digital Signatures?

First, Bob need to derive the hash `h` from the message, i.e. `h = hash(msg)`,
and need to attach the message with the hash to the public.

<Callout>
  Bob wants to sign a message so that Alice and everyone else could know the
  message is issued by Bob, so he signs a signature `S`, which is the encrypted
  `h` using **private key**: `S = h^d mod n`
</Callout>
<Callout>
  Alice (and everyone else) is given a signature `S`, the hash `h'` could be
  found using **public key** `h' = S^e mod n`
</Callout>

Finally, anyone just have to compare the `h'` and `h`, so that they could know
if the signature is really signed by the Bob, who hold the private key.

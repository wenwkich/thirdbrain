# Hooks

- `useState()` hook to store simple data
- `useEffect()` hook to replace `componentDidMount()` `componentWillUnmount()`
  and `componentDidUpdate()` to manage lifecycles
- `useContext()` hook to allow you access global state by `Context` API of react
- `useReducer()` hook to allow you use Redux-style code to manage state
  lifecycle
- `useCallback()` hook to return memorized callback, here's a
  [guide](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-usecallback/)
- `useRef()` hook to fold elements and mutable values
- react hook utility such as [react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use)
  - `useThrottle()` and `useDebounce()` allows you to reduce frequent calls
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/): A strategy to first return the data from cache
  (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the
  up-to-date data
  - similar library that does this is

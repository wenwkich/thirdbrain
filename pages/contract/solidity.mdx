# Solidity

Most people would want to get started on
[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/), right now with `v0.8.17`
released. Here we only talk about Solidity, which is the Smart Contract Language
of Ethereum.

Unlike Javascript, it is a statically-type language (js is interpreted and
untyped) but it's -

- [Turing Complete](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2464/what-does-it-mean-that-ethereum-is-turing-complete)
- [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
- allows
  [Multiple Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance)

Ethereum also prevented a major issue in computing world, that is
[halting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem), meaning we'll never
know a program will ever finished running, which is known to be unsolvable.

Ethereum prevented the halting issue by introducing
[gas](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/), when you run an operation
on the stack machine, user who initiated the transaction are expected to pay the
transaction fee calculated by `gas_use * gas_price`, and after the given gas is
used up, the transaction will stop.

## How to learn

The fastest way is to study it with
[examples](https://solidity-by-example.org/).

If you prefer a game one, use [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/), and
it's constantly updating.

[Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/) is also a good choice to get
started on Ethereum.

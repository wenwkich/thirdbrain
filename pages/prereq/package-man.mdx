# Package Management

No matter you want to get started on smart contract development or frontend development,
You should probably start on installation of Node.js & NPM (both frontend and smart contract
frameworks rely on Node.js and npm).
As I use Mac, it's convenient for me to install and manage the version using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Alternative to `npm`

If you're still using `npm`, I would suggest to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as it's much faster to
add a package & especially when you need to install the package after cloning other's code (since it's
parallel).
After you install `npm`, you use `npm install --global yarn` command to install `yarn`.

Then you just have to use:

- `yarn` to replace `npm install`
- `yarn add <package-name>` to replace `npm install <package-name>`
- `yarn create react-app` to replace `npm create-react-app`
- but something like `npx` is not replaceable

You'll also need to learn how to write the `scripts` section in `package.json`,
see [offical doc](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts)
